        smart contract code. Typically, these contracts are written in Solidity
        programming language and provided via GitHub. Security audits are
        particularly valuable for Defi projects that expect to handle blockchain
        transactions worth millions of dollars or a huge amount of players.

        ZexDex is a decentralized exchange. Users do not need to register and
        can transact directly with their wallets. Unlike centralized exchanges.
        ZexDex doesn't keep your coins while trading. Liquidity pools enable
        users to buy and sell crypto on decentralized exchanges and other DeFi
        platforms without the need for centralized market makers.
